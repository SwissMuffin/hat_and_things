# 19. Introduction to jQuery

Often, when developing a web application, we need to integrate a particular  feature, but we don't necessarily want to code the feature from scratch  by ourselves. Usually the decision to use code that someone else wrote  is purely pragmatic; we simply don't have the time to develop a complex  feature completely by ourselves. The Bootstrap CSS framework is a  classic example of a renowned open-source code library, but a similarly  common library to come across is the jQuery JavaScript library.

To understand why jQuery is so popular, we need to remember that  JavaScript has been evolving since its inception, and that many of the  features that we now take for granted didn't actually exist in previous  versions. For example, being able to use CSS selectors in JavaScript is  now possible with `document.querySelector()`. However, jQuery made this feature possible in a developer-friendly way  quite early-on, along with many other features that would reduce the  amount of code that a developer would need to write. There were other  JavaScript libraries at the same time that jQuery became popular, but  these were mostly abandoned as the community around jQuery flourished,  and developers began publishing their own plugins for jQuery.

As time went on, jQuery was adopted by other influential projects,  including Bootstrap, which continues to use jQuery on several of its  components. But as "Vanilla" (plain, library-less) JavaScript became  more modern, in particular with ES6, jQuery was rendered largely  obsolete. However; many older web sites and web apps still use jQuery,  so as developers, we need to be able to recognize it when we see it.

The largest drawback to jQuery today, apart from its obsolescence, is the size of the library, which is not insignificant --especially for  web sites that target mobile users. There are some arguments for the  continued use of jQuery, but for the most part, we should be reasonably  skeptical of developers, blog posts, or StackOverflow answers that  suggest using jQuery to solve a particular problem.

jQuery's syntax is easily identifiably by the use of the "dollar" symbol: `$`. The table below shows us the jQuery syntax for several common use-cases, as well as "vanilla" JavaScript solutions for each.

| Use-case                                           | jQuery                 | ordinary JavaScript                            |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Select all elements with the "primary-color" class | `$(".primary-color");` | `document.querySelectorAll('.primary-color');` |
| Hide a DOM element                                 | `$(el).hide();`        | `el.style.display = 'none';`                   |
| Reveal a DOM element                               | `$(el).show();`        | `el.style.display = '';`                       |
| Remove the contents of an element                  | `$(el).empty();`       | `el.innerHTML = '';`                           |

The examples above are just a few of the ways in which plain  JavaScript can do what we need it to do, and why using jQuery can be  unnecessary. Notice the `$` symbols  that prepend each jQuery expression. When we see this character on  StackOverflow posts, it is likely that the posted code or the answer  that we are looking at is using jQuery, and that answer is not relevant  to us unless we happen to be using jQuery too.

------

The JavaScript ecosystem is full of different libraries and  frameworks --many of which are more modern and relevant than jQuery is.  However, it could well be that we find ourselves working on an older  project that uses jQuery, and it is important that we can identify it  when we see it.
