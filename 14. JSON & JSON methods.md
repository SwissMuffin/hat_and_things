In this lesson, we'll be learning about JSON, which is the primary format  for transferring data on the web. JSON stands for JavaScript Object  Notation, and it is a format for writing data that is based on how we  write JavaScript object in code.  As we look at some JSON examples, keep in mind that JSON is *not* code that is executed; it is just a  data format. We can use JSON to create JavaScript objects, but JSON is  just a string containing some structured data.  When we want to create a JavaScript object from JSON, we have to *parse* the JSON.  We'll soon look at what parsing means, but let's begin by first exploring JSON syntax.

------

Below, we can see a comparison of a JSON object with a JavaScript  object. Each object contains the same properties, but the formatting is  more strict for the JSON object.

#### JSON

```json
{
    "name": "Jane",
    "age": 32,
    "profession": "Dev Ops Engineer",
    "favoriteFoods": ["tofu", "hamburgers"]
}
```

#### JavaScript

```js
{
    name: "Jane",
    age: 32,
    profession: "Dev Ops Engineer",
    favoriteFoods: ["tofu", "hamburgers"]
}
```

The main difference to notice is that the JSON object's properties are strings that are wrapped in double quotes `"`, and this must *always* be the case. JSON objects can also contain all of the same data types  that JavaScript objects can contain, including other nested JSON  objects.

But we can't use a JSON object like we can use a JavaScript object.  In fact, JSON data in JavaScript is actually formatted as a string, so  if we wanted to include the JSON object above in some JavaScript, we  would have to wrap it in quotes `''`, like this:

```js
let jsonString = '{ "name": "Jane", "age": 32, "profession": "Dev Ops Engineer", "favoriteFoods": ["tofu", "hamburgers"] }';
```

We'll look at what that means in just a little bit, but for now, the  important thing to remember is that a JSON object is different from a  JavaScript object, and it is used for storing and transferring data over the web.

## XML

JSON is not, however, the only way that data is transferred over the  web. XML, a markup language used to be the primary way that data was  sent over the internet. XML stands for *eXtensible Markup Language*, and it looks similar to HTML, but custom tags can be used as a way of  defining objects and their properties. If you haven't seen it before,  XML syntax looks like this:

```xml
<thisIsACustomTag>
    <someText>Hello World</someText>
</thisIsACustomTag>
```

Just like HTML, XML has opening tags and closing tags, with content  in-between. XML is stored in an XML document, which is a file that has  the `.xml` extension. Many web  applications and services still use XML as their default format, and  it's important to understand why JSON is becoming more popular than XML.

## JSON vs. XML

JSON is easier for *people* to read than XML. To demonstrate  this point, let's have a look at the same data object from our example  above, as compared to XML. Notice in particular how the array is defined in XML.

#### JSON

```json
{
    "name": "Jane",
    "age": 32,
    "profession": "Dev Ops Engineer",
    "favoriteFoods": ["tofu", "hamburgers"]
}
```

#### XML

```xml
<person>
    <name>Jane</name>
    <age>32age>
    <profession>Dev Ops Engineer</profession>
    <favoriteFoods  type="array">
        <value>tofu</value>
        <value>hamburgers</value>
    </favoriteFoods>
</person>
```

The XML code in this example looks far more crowded than the JSON  code. It actually uses 68 more characters to express the object as XML  than it does as JSON. This might seem insignificant in this isolated  comparison, but just imagine that we were looking at a file that  contained thousands of objects. Being able to easily read and navigate  our code is so important, and it's the primary reason why JSON has  become more popular than XML.

JSON is also very easy to use with JavaScript, so let's explore some  of the ways that JSON objects can be read and created with JS.

## Converting JavaScript objects to JSON

Let's create some JSON out of a regular JavaScript object. To do this, we'll use `JSON.stringify()` with the `person` example from our comparisons above.

```js
let person = {
  name: 'Jane',
  age: 32,
  profession: 'Dev Ops Engineer',
  favoriteFoods: ['tofu', 'hamburgers']
};

let personAsJSON = JSON.stringify(person); // returns a JSON string
```

Let's examine the `personAsJSON` variable in a few different ways:

```js
console.log(typeof personAsJSON); // logs 'string'
console.log(personAsJSON); // logs '{ "name": "Jane", "age": 32, "profession": "Dev Ops Engineer", "favoriteFoods": ["tofu", "hamburgers"] }'
```

Notice how using `JSON.stringify()` converted the single-quotes `''` in our JavaScript object to double-quotes `""` in the JSON string. It also wrapped each property name in double quotes, which is the proper syntax for JSON properties.

Being able to easily convert JavaScript to JSON is very helpful in  the preparation of data for export, and for submitting form data as  well. This idea will be examined in the later units on AJAX and local  storage, so for now, just remember that we can create JSON strings out  of JavaScript objects with the `JSON.stringify()` method.

## Converting JSON strings to JavaScript objects

Now that we have a working example of a JSON string, let's try  converting it back into a JavaScript object. Remember that the data, in  its current format, is relatively useless to us if we wanted to loop  through the object, or look-up a property's value. Thankfully, there is a counter-part to the `JSON.stringify()` method that can create for us a JavaScript object out of a JSON string.

Parsing JSON data in JavaScript is made simple by the `JSON.parse()` method, and it is a very helpful tool when it comes to importing large  amounts of data in a web application. For now, let's just use it to  create an object from  our `personAsJSON` string.

```js
let personAsObject = JSON.parse(personAsJSON); // returns a JavaScript object

console.log(typeof personAsObject); // logs 'object'
console.log(personAsObject); // logs Object { name: "Jane", age: 32, profession: "Dev Ops Engineer", favoriteFoods: […] }
```

The code above shows us how using `JSON.parse()` can help us to import JSON data so that we can manipulate it as a regular JavaScript object.

JSON data is a central part of any modern web application. We'll be  exploring how JSON is transferred over the internet in our next unit on  AJAX and APIs.
