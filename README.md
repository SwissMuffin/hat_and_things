# A clothing accessory wishlist

The project is intended to enhance two static web pages.  The two pages are for a wishlist on a clothing accessories website.  

The aim of the site is to allow visitors to view clothing accessories by category (hats, gloves, socks, and sunglasses), filter by color, and then add up to three items to their own wishlist.  

The wishlist can then be viewed, and items can be removed from the wishlist.

Currently, the website is just static HTML, CSS, and images; the goal is to render these static them to be dynamic.
