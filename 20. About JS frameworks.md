Up to this point, this course has been all about JavaScript fundamentals:  about the core language, and how it can be used to build an interactive  user interface by manipulating elements of the DOM.

Now we'll take a step back from code and look at the wider picture  around JavaScript.  The remaining units aren't about writing JavaScript  code; they are about appreciating the libraries and tools that have been built with JavaScript, and getting a glimpse of the different ways that JavaScript has been used for web development in recent years.  We'll  start in this unit by looking at JavaScript *front end frameworks*.

As we've seen, JavaScript is the way that interactive user  experiences are built in modern web applications.  It's possible to  build *any* user interface feature that exists in a modern  website from scratch using JavaScript.  It just depends on how complex  and how difficult that feature is to build.

JavaScript has been around a long time though and there are many  useful libraries available that can be used to build complex user  interfaces.  This means it isn't always necessary to write every bit of  JavaScript from scratch.  Some of these libraries are for very specific  types of functionality, and there are others that are used as building  blocks for the entire user interface.  We've already looked at one of  the all-time most popular libraries, jQuery.

Large libraries that are used to structure the interactions between the interface are *front end frameworks*.  In some ways, jQuery can be considered the precursor to modern front  end frameworks.  It became a popular library that included consistent  functions for manipulating the DOM, and therefore the user interface,  and *also* for interacting with a remote server via AJAX.  But  what jQuery lacks is a consistent and structured way to combine all of  it's features together.

This is where modern *front end frameworks* have stepped in:  they provide complex libraries written in JavaScript that are used to  connect different parts of the user interface together.  This might  include JavaScript events, input elements, underlying JSON data  structures, and requests to remote servers all bound together so that  the interface as a whole updates and changes seamlessly.

A small example would be an input and a button that submits an email  address by AJAX, and then the response displays an HTML element  containing the success or failure message to the user.  A framework  provides the "plumbing" to connect the input, the button, the AJAX  request, the response data, *and* the HTML to display the message together.

The end result for us is less code to write in order to achieve that  functionality.  But the difficulty is learning how to use the framework, and knowing whether a framework is even necessary.

Let's take an example.  One of the most popular current front end  frameworks is React, which was built by Facebook.  This particular  framework started out as a project that would handle different types of  asynchronous updates on the Facebook feed in an organized way.  It was  JavaScript code that solved a particular user interface problem for  Facebook.  Facebook developed it, then made it available as open source  software and it can now be used to build a web page that keeps aspects  of a web interface updated based on the inputs and interactions of a  person using it.

There are plenty of other front end frameworks available.  The most  frequently mentioned ones are Angular (built by Google), Ember JS, and  vue.js, but there are many others.  Some frameworks have similarities  with others but they each have their particular strengths.  And they can also vary greatly in how they are structured and what they are best  used for.  The differences can be seen in how these front end frameworks have different architectures with different names, so acronyms and  terms like "MVC", "MVVM", "component-based", and others are encountered  when reading and comparing different frameworks.

And all of this makes it daunting to know what the "correct" framework is  to try to study in order to build a modern web interface.  It's  important to remember that it's *not necessary* to learn *any* framework to build a fully functional web application; front end  frameworks tend to be complex and involve some form of steep learning  curve.  But they are still JavaScript plus HTML at the core.

Possibly the most important point is that these front end frameworks  are popular solutions for building complex websites and applications in  real projects.  This means that they are often mentioned in any blog  posts or answers on forums like Stack Overflow.  If we are looking for  an explanation of how to achieve something with JavaScript, the answer  could be a solution *framed around* using a particular framework.  Being able to recognize when an article or answer does this is an  important skill.  Really, this is just an extension of the awareness  needed to distinguish between articles written with code samples in ES5  and ES6, and not much more than thoroughly reading whatever source of  information we have in front of us.

Of course, using a particular front end framework can be  advantageous, but recommending a particular JavaScript framework is  tricky.  As we'll see in the next unit, the "world" of JavaScript has  moved very quickly over the last five years or so, and that means a lot  of competing frameworks to choose from, not to mention libraries and  tools, with new competitors appearing almost weekly.

So let's learn a bit more about the JavaScript eco-system.
