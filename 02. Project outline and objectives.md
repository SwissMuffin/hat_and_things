# 02. Project outline and objectives

​       

### A clothing accessory wishlist

The project for this course is to enhance two static web pages, using all of the JavaScript techniques that you've learnt throughout the  course.  The two pages are for a wishlist on a clothing accessories  website.  The aim of the site is to allows visitors to view clothing  accessories by category (hats, gloves, socks, and sunglasses), filter by color, and then add up to three items to their own wishlist.  The  wishlist can then be viewed, and items can be removed from the wishlist.

Currently, the website is static HTML, CSS, and images; your job is  to make these static web pages work dynamically with different  JavaScript techniques.  The static website, which is the project  starting point, is attached to the resources tab of this unit.  Download the zip file containing the different HTML and CSS assets, store them  all in an appropriate folder for you to work on and have a look at what  the two HTML files look like in Firefox.

The zip file includes an initial git repository; ensure that the repository is set up correctly by running `git status` in the terminal before starting on the project work.  If the repository does not exist, set it up using `git init`.

*It is important to regularly commit the changes that you make in your project using git.*  Proof of your git commit history is a required part of your project submission.

Once you have downloaded the files, looked through the HTML and  checked the git repository, work through the following tasks to  demonstrate the JavaScript techniques that you've learnt.  They don't  have to be completed in the order that they are listed, although they  are listed in an order that should get progressively more challenging.

*Don't forget that `console.log` can be used to output information in any functions you write.  `console.log` can be very useful to help to identify why something isn't working in your JavaScript code.*

#### Hats

The static `products.html` file includes 12 different hats as distinct HTML components.  There is an empty JavaScript file, `assets/javascripts/products.js` that is already included in the `products.html` file that can be used for all JavaScript related to the `products.html` page.

- [x] Define a simple JavaScript object that represents a hat, with properties `name`, `price`, `color`, and `imageHref`.  Attach a function `toString()` to the object that will return a String that nicely formats the properties of the hat object i.e. `"<name>, color <color>, price: <price>, image: <imageHref>"`.  *You can test this object using `console.log()`.*
- [x] Now define a JavaScript prototype for a Hat that can be used to  construct the object from the previous task.  The prototype will need to set the property of a hat: `name`, `price`, `color`, and `imageHref`.  Add a function `toString()` to the prototype that is the same as the `toString()` method from the previous task.  *Leave the object created in the previous task at the top of your products.js file.*
- [x] Define an array of hat objects using the Hat prototype that represent all of the hats in the static HTML.
- [x] Define a function `displayHat(hat)` that will accept a Hat object and create an HTML component using that  object.  The HTML component needs to exactly match the structure of an  individual static HTML hat component.  Use the function to render all of the hat objects on the `products.html` page *instead of* the static HTML.

#### Filter by color

The `products.html` page includes a filter-by-color control and this should show or hide the hats that match the selected color.

- [x] First, write a function `highlightSelectedFilter()` that will remove the `active` CSS class from all filter buttons, and then add the `active` CSS class to the filter button that was clicked.  Bind this function to each of filter buttons on the `products.html` page.
- [x] It will be necessary to select all hat components that match the  color of the filter button that has been clicked.  For each hat object,  set an extra CSS class name on the root element of the hat HTML  component (i.e. the element with class name `accessory`).  The additional CSS class will be the value of the `color` property of the hat object used to render that component.
- [x] Now write an empty function `filterHatsByColor()`.  Bind this function as a click event to each of the filter buttons.
- [x] Implement the following in `filterHatsByColor()`.  First, the function will hide every hat component.  Then the function will use the `textContent` of the clicked button to select only the hat components that match that color and display only those hat components.
- [x] Add HTML to the filters for an extra button, `All`.  Bind `filterHatsByColor()` to this button as well.  Make this button display *all of the hats* when it is clicked.

#### Socks and sunglasses

There are two JSON files included in the initial project.  These  contain two new categories of accessories: socks and sunglasses.  Work  through these tasks first for the socks category and then the sunglasses category.

- [x] Compare the structure of the JSON objects with your Hat prototype.   Make any adjustments to the Hat prototype so that it has the same  structure as the sock and sunglasses objects.  You might also need to  adjust some of your code based on any changes made to the Hat prototype.
- [x] Rename the Hat prototype to Accessory, so that it has an appropriate name to be used for the other two categories of Accessories.  Rename  any other functions or variables that mention "Hat" to "Accessory".  *From this point on, the project outline refers to generic "accessories" rather than "hats".*
- [x] Write a function `loadRemoteAccessories()`.  The function will use the `textContent` of the button that it is bound to retrieve the objects for that  category via AJAX.  The AJAX request will get the JSON file for the  category, which contains those types of accessories.  It will then  remove all of the currently loaded Accessory HTML components, create  Accessory objects from each of the retrieved JSON objects, and render  Accessory components for each of these accessory objects on the page.   Bind the function so that when the "Socks" or "Sunglasses" links are  clicked, the accessories for that category are displayed.
- [x] Write and bind a function that will reload the hats when the "Hats" link is clicked.

#### Gloves

Gloves are a fourth category that needs to be added to the wishlist  app.  Gloves will need to be loaded from file in the same way as socks  and sunglasses.  Below is a table for the three glove products that are  to be shown on the wishlist app, with the values for each of the  properties.

| Name              | Color  | Price | Image HREF                          |
| ----------------- | ------ | ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| Standard gloves   | red    | 16.99 | `assets/images/red/gloves/1.png`    |
| Standard gloves   | blue   | 16.99 | `assets/images/blue/gloves/1.png`   |
| Standard gloves   | green  | 16.99 | `assets/images/green/gloves/1.png`  |
| Fingerless gloves | red    | 14.99 | `assets/images/red/gloves/2.png`    |
| Fingerless gloves | yellow | 14.99 | `assets/images/yellow/gloves/2.png` |
| Fingerless gloves | blue   | 14.99 | `assets/images/blue/gloves/2.png`   |
| Mittens gloves    | red    | 18.99 | `assets/images/red/gloves/3.png`    |
| Mittens gloves    | green  | 18.99 | `assets/images/green/gloves/3.png`  |

- [x] Create a new JSON file and add all of the gloves in the table above in a structure that matches the Accessory prototype.
- [x] Add HTML with the text "Gloves" to the header of the `products.html` page and bind the `loadRemoteAccessories` function to this link so that it will remove the currently displayed products and render a component for each of the gloves.

#### The wishlist

Adding items to a wishlist is the core feature of this mini-site.  It is also the most complex to implement.  The wishlist needs to be stored across browser sessions and requires sophisticated manipulation of  objects and Strings.

- [x] Write an empty function `addToWishlist(accessory)` that takes an accessory object as a parameter.  For each accessory component rendered on `products.html`, bind the `addToWishlist(accessory)` function to the "Add to wishlist!" button for that component.  Ensure  that the binding allows the associated accessory object for that  component to be passed as the parameter.
- [x] Implement `addToWishlist(accessory)` so that it will store *one* accessory using the key `'accessory1'` and it can be retrieved *across sessions*.  Whenever the function is executed, it replaces the previously stored accessory with the new one.
- [ ] Alter the `addToWishlist(accessory)` function so that *up to three* accessories can be added to the wishlist.  Each accessory will be stored with one of the keys `'accessory1'`, `'accessory2'`, or `'accessory3'`.  If there are already three accessories stored using those keys, display an `alert()` indicating that the wishlist is full.
- [ ] The `wishlist.html` file does not have any JavaScript file attached to it.  Create a new JavaScript file within `assets/javascripts/` for this HTML page and write a function that will retrieve all of the stored accessories.
- [ ] Write a function `displayWishlist()` in the new JavaScript file that will render each of the stored accessories on the `wishlist.html` page *instead of* the static hat components that are included in that file.  This  function will need to use the function from the previous task first.   This might be an opportunity to create several smaller functions that  are called within `displayWishlist()`.
- [ ] Ensure that any errors are handled when trying to render each component.
- [ ] Write a function `removeFromWishlist(key, htmlComponent)` that will accept a storage key and an HTML element.  The function will  remove the accessory stored for the given key and also remove the HTML  element from the DOM.  Bind this function to each "Remove" button  rendered in the wishlist, passing the correct key to the button.

### Project aims

The project must demonstrate the following aspects of the JavaScript programming language taught in this course:

- Using arrays, loops and conditionals.
- Using ES6 syntax and constructs.
- Declaring objects and defining prototypes.
- Defining functions and binding functions to events.
- Adding, deleting and moving elements in the DOM.
- Altering contents of an element in the DOM.
- Retrieving data via AJAX and defining data structures with JSON.
- Using JSON Strings (serialized JSON) in local storage.
- Appropriate error handling.
- Modular definition and organization of functions.

### Code style

Up to this point, we have not explicitly talked about *code style*.  Code style is the format in which we write our code that *is not* strict syntax rules of the language, and includes things like  indentation of code and where to use whitespace like spaces, tabs and  carriage returns.  What makes "good" code style is subjective, but there are sets of widely accepted rules for formatting code in all popular  languages.  And we can use "code formatters" to tidy up our code too,  which makes that task of code formatting a lot easier than checking  every line that we write.  The `atom-beautify` package for the Atom text editor comes with formatters for CSS and  HTML, and further code formatters can easily be added for other  languages too.  Adding the `atom-beautify` package will help write well-formatted code files in all of your project work.

Make sure that you install the `atom-beautify` code formatter for Atom and submit JavaScript files that have been formatted according to the default code style in the `atom-beautify` package.  An open JavaScript file, ending `.js`, can be formatted using the keyboard combination of `ctrl+alt+b`.  This will reformat the file according to the `atom-beautify` code style definition.  And by using this code formatter, you will  eventually get in the habit of writing your JavaScript in a consistent  style.

The same is true for CSS and HTML, so you can use it for those files too. **There is a bug with the default HTML formatter (`JS Beautify`) at the moment, so go to the `Packages` section of Atom,  and make sure that you change the `Default Beautifier` for HTML from `JS Beautify` to `Pretty Diff` if you are beautifying HTML files.**

*Be aware that code style is a topic that some developers have  very strong opinions about – it's best to try to follow the code style  defined on existing projects initially rather than write code in a  conflicting style.  A well-organized project will include a _linter* definition, which includes all of the preferred code style settings for that project._

### HTML and CSS

The project does not carry any marks for use of HTML and CSS beyond  the HTML changes that are mentioned in the tasks above.  If you feel the need to adjust an HTML or CSS in order to demonstrate your JavaScript  skills fully, then make these changes but note that these changes to  HTML and CSS will not gain extra marks.  Also, any such changes must not negatively impact the visual layout and functions of the web pages.

You should use the Firefox web browser to make sure that the HTML and CSS renders correctly.  The layout has been created using [the popular Bootstrap CSS library](https://getbootstrap.com/).   Bootstrap is a collection of HTML, CSS and JavaScript patterns that  make it quick and easy to prototype the front-end of a web application,  such as in this project.  Bootstrap is a good option to use for  prototyping; some developers use Bootstrap to build finished website but this should be avoided as Bootstrap restricts the control that you can  have with your own custom CSS rules.

### Project submission

You will need to submit your project as a GitHub repository.  Once  you have completed your project, create a new repository on your  Extension School account and push all of your project code to this  repository.  Copy the repository URL and enter this URL as your project  submission.
