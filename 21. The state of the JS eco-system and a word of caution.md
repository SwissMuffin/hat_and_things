# 21. The state of the JS eco-system and a word of caution

- â€‹              [Content](https://learn.extensionschool.ch/learn/programs/web-application-development-v1/subjects/advanced-javascript-techniques-v1/units/the-state-of-the-js-eco-system-and-a-word-of-caution-v1#content)            

We just learnt a little about JavaScript *front end frameworks* and that they are useful to build complex interactive user interfaces.  We *didn't* look at any framework in particular however.  This is because the *speed* at which the JavaScript language has developed over the last few years, and also the speed with which new libraries and tools have been  released for JavaScript, makes choosing a framework to focus on a  gamble.

In this unit, we'll take the biggest step back possible from the  JavaScript fundamentals that we've been learning, and look at the  JavaScript eco-system as a whole.  We'll look at some of JavaScript's  recent history and look at why it's important to have a good  understanding of what's happening around programming languages and  technologies that we use day-to-day.  At this point in our journey, this is more important than focusing on one framework or library in detail.

When we talk about an "eco-system" around a programming language, we  mean the language itself, how that language is developed and improved,  the libraries and tools that are available for that language, and the  community that works on and uses the language.  It means everything that revolves around that language over time.

## node.js

First, let's talk about the release of a piece of software called *node.js* that allows JavaScript to be run outside of a browser window, for  example in a laptop terminal.  The release of node.js was a major  milestone in the development of JavaScript.

Before node.js, JavaScript was a language used to write scripts that  run in browser windows.  node.js is a library that enabled developers to write JavaScript programs that run *outside* of the browser and therefore use it for things other than DOM manipulation and AJAX.  In particular, node.js is *"... an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, ... designed to build scalable network applications."*  This means that node.js can be used to run JavaScript in the terminal but is designed *specifically* to build applications that serve web pages (the "scalable network application" part).

node.js in particular has resulted in the development of many  packages and applications in JavaScript.  It became possible to bundle  together a "package" of JavaScript code with a particular purpose and  easily published it to a central repository on the internet called npm,  which is hosted at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com).  This  meant that the things that JavaScript could be used for expanded hugely, and a lot of developers built and published different packages,  libraries and frameworks to npm for others to use freely.

The drawback has been that the enthusiasm to build new things has  created an eco-system where there are often competing frameworks and  libraries for any one particular need.  This has been compounded by the  speed with which alternatives are released, making the crowded and  confusing landscape somewhat overwhelming.  The multitude of libraries  and technologies can be difficult to navigate when you are an  experienced developer, let alone when at the start of a journey into web development.

## The state of JavaScript

There are resources available online to help keep track of what's  happening and also what libraries are most popular.  One of these, [The State of JavaScript](https://stateofjs.com/), includes a thorough analysis of what libraries have been most popular  in a calendar year.  It's a good place to have a look and get an idea of the names of different libraries and what has been used a lot in the  past year.

But what do we do about using any of these things?  The best thing at this stage in learning JavaScript is to focus on learning "plain old"  JavaScript, and the differences between the ES5 and ES6 versions of  JavaScript.  As we saw in the last unit, any background reading about  JavaScript might be in the context of a particular framework or library.  It's important to be aware if this is the case, so articles that  mention *React*, *Angular*, *vue.js*, or *jQuery* for example will reference particular features from each of those  libraries and the solutions that they describe might not work if the  code we're writing only uses plain JavaScript.  If a solution *is* in context of using some sort of framework or library, then it'll be  necessary to look for a different reference that is pure JavaScript.   Or, perhaps, it's actually an opportunity to start learning about that  particular framework.

It's possible to have a career developing user interfaces for  browsers and never use anything other than "plain old JavaScript", as  we've been learning in this course.

But the likelihood is that you will encounter one or more of these  frameworks or libraries at some point, so become familiar with the  landscape of JavaScript.  Websites like [stateofjs.com](https://stateofjs.com) are great for a snapshot of what's popular and what's new.  And if you  are inclined to try out a particular framework because it seems  interesting, then great!

In the next unit, we'll learn a bit more about node.js and how this  has turned JavaScript from a "front-end" programming language to a "full stack" programming language.
