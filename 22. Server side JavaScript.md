# 22. Server side JavaScript

In the last unit, we were introduced to a JavaScript tool called node.js.  Node.js, or simply "node", has been a pivotal development in the  history of JavaScript.  We'll look at what node was specifically built  to achieve in this unit, and learn some more of background details about the JavaScript eco-system.

Node.js is a package that can be installed on a laptop or a server, and is a *JavaScript runtime*.  This means that we can use node.js to run JavaScript code *outside* of a browser.

##  JavaScript, the "fullstack" programming language

The primary purpose of node.js is to use it to create a small web  server.  It runs as an application on a server, and can receive and  process web requests, and return the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files that the browser uses to display the web page and it's interactive parts.

This means that node.js can be used to build a web application *entirely* with JavaScript.  All of the user interface code, loaded in the browser, can be built with JavaScript but *also* all of the code that runs on a web server and handles incoming web  requests can be written in JavaScript.  This means that some fullstack  web developers focus entirely on JavaScript and the technologies built  with JavaScript.

And writing in one programming language, JavaScript, is convenient.   It means that there is not much need to learn another programming  language beyond JavaScript.  This makes JavaScript the only programming  language that is "fullstack": it's the only programming language that  can be used without any *other* language to build the front-end and back-end code for a web application.

It's clearly beneficial to use just one programming language to write all the code for a web application.  We don't have to learn the  different syntax of a second programming language, or install different  tools for developing and running a second programming language.  And  this is possible with JavaScript because of node.js.

As we learnt in the last unit, JavaScript in general has had a  massive rise in popularity over recent years, largely because of node.js and the fact that it opened the doors for building web applications  front-to-back with JavaScript.  It is used for lots of real web  applications, and it's important to recognise that node.js is a  JavaScript technology that underpins a lot of modern web development.

## Web frameworks, the "back end"

Just as there are front-end frameworks, like React and Angular, there are also *web frameworks* that provide a structure so that building the back-end of a full web  application is easier.  node.js is used in some of these web frameworks.  But, unlike the front-end JavaScript frameworks, there are many *web frameworks* that have been built using different programming languages besides JavaScript.

Let's look at a broader picture that involves some more programming  languages and technologies for building the "back end" of a web  application.  The table below lists some popular programming languages,  and the web frameworks built in those languages.  (JavaScript and  node.js are put together because although JavaScript is the programming  language, it's node.js that enables developers to build and use the web  frameworks)

| Programming language | Web frameworks |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| JavaScript / node.js | express.js     |
|                      | sails.js       |
| Ruby                 | Ruby on Rails  |
|                      | Sinatra        |
| Python               | Django         |
| PHP                  | Laravel        |
| C#                   | ASP.NET MVC    |

All of the programming languages listed above have their strengths  and weakness, and the same is true for the web frameworks.  The  important point is that there are many programming languages that can be used for the back-end besides JavaScript.

## More than just JavaScript

So, although we can use JavaScript along with node.js to build the  back-end for a web application, it's also an opportunity to try  something different.

For this program, we've selected Ruby as the programming language and Ruby on Rails as the web framework to teach back-end or *server-side* development.  Ruby is a different programming language to JavaScript.   There are some similarities but also many differences.  It is an  advantage to learn more than one programming language, and be familiar  with several different languages as the relative strengths and  weaknesses can be seen.  It might be that you find one programming  language much more natural than another but the only way to know is by  learning to use them.  This doesn't mean becoming an expert, just having some experience in order to make comparisons.

So, in this unit we've learnt that JavaScript can be used to build  the full stack of a web application, largely thanks to the development  of the node.js runtime.  We've also seen that back-end development can  be tackled with many programming languages besides JavaScript.  And  we've also learnt that there are "web frameworks" that can be used to  aid the development of the back-end of a web application.

In the next unit, we'll get back to JavaScript before getting started on the course project
